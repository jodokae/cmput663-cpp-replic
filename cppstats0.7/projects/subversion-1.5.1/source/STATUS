Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================


 * r31658, r31659
   Fix a remaining bug with issue #2825, Handle --depth option for 'merge'
   operations in terms of both content and mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     An inoperative merge to a directory at --depth files should set
     non-inheritable mergeinfo on the merge target and 'normal' mergeinfo
     on any of the target's file children.  Without this fix the file
     children get no mergeinfo set/updated.  This is a fairly minor bug, but
     it is inconsistent with the way we currently handle inoperative merges
     in every other situation (i.e. we still set mergeinfo - see issue #2883).

=================


 * r31313
   Make all ra layers return a consistent error when a path is not
   found in the repository.
   Notes:
     Small change, but API consistency is always a good thing.
     Does not merge cleanly!
   Question:
     Does r32056, nominated below, fix these test failures?
